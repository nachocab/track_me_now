# TrackMeNow
TrackMeNow is what I use every day to keep track of my working hours. It is an opinionated spreadsheet designed to stay out of your way and give you simple, meaningful information about what you have done during the day. I have been using it for two years; without it, I feel empty. Download it [here][trackmenow].

## Details
When you want to start a new day, simply select the B column and press `Delete`.

If you work past midnight, enter the time as 24:00 instead of 0:00 (25:00 instead of 1:00, etc.). It's an MS Excel quirk, tell me if you know how to fix it.

## Collaboration
I welcome your feedback, just send me a message.
