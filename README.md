# TrackMeNow
TrackMeNow is what I use every day to track my working hours. It is an opinionated spreadsheet designed to stay out of your way and tell what you have done during the day. I have been using it for two years; without it, I feel empty. Download it [here][trackmenow].

## Details
Adjust your zoom so you see at least up to the F column.

If your Excel is in Spanish, use `Ctrl Shift .` instead of `Ctrl Shift ,` to add the current time.

When you want to start a new day, simply select the B column and press `Delete`.

The spreadsheet is protected to avoid showing Excel's green triangles. Go to `Tools | Protection | Unprotect Sheet` to unprotect it.

## Collaboration
I welcome any feedback, just send me a message.
